# Title

     Travel Diary Platform Backend Development

## Objective

    To Develop a backend API for a Travel Diary Platform, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete travel entries. The project should demonstrate skill in building a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and a database, while integrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Tech Stack

    Used Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, Restful API's
